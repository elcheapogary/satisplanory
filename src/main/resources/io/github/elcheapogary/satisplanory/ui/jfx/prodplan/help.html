        This screen is the production planner - a tool to calculate how many buildings configured with which recipes
        are required to produce a certain number of items per minute given the availability of certain input items.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are three sets of data that can be configured:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Recipes</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Here you select which recipes the calculator can consider when calculating a production plan.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Input Items</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                These are the input items that are available to be used in the production plan. These can be raw
                resources or products of other factories.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Output Requirements</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                This is which items you would like to produce. You can configure a specific amount or as many as
                possible.
            </p>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p><b>Recipes</b></p>

    <p>
        You can select any or all of the default or alternate recipes. You can search for recipes by name, or by the
        item they produce.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you select no recipes, or a production plan is not possible with the recipes you have selected, the
        calculator will attempt to find the best recipes to use and will suggest them to you.
    </p>

    <p><b>Input Items</b></p>

    <p>
        These are the items the calculator will attempt to use as input for the production lines. You can add all raw
        resources on the map by using the "Add All Raw Resources" button.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you add no input items, or if a production plan is not possible with the input items you have selected, then
        the calculator will attempt to find the input items required to create a production plan and suggest them to
        you.
    </p>

    <p><b>Output Items</b></p>

    <p>
        These are the items you would like the production lines to produce.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each item can have a minimum amount per minute and a maximization weight. The calculator will attempt to create
        a production plan that produces at least the configured minimum items per minute, and as much as possible of the
        items with a weight value greater than zero.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Note!</b> If you configure a minimum of zero for a particular item, then the calculator may create a
        production plan that produces none of that item!
    </p>

    <p>
        You must add at least one output item that has either a minimum number of items per minute greater than zero or
        a weight greater than zero.
    </p>

    <p>
        The calculator will attempt to balance the output items according to their weight. eg. If you configure Iron
        Rods with a weight of 2 and Iron Plates with a weight of 3, then the calculator will attempt to create a
        production plan which produces 3 Iron Plates for every 2 Iron Rods. This, however, is not strictly enforced.
        If, for some reason, fewer Iron Plates are producible then the calculator will still attempt to maximize Iron
        Rods, even if output ratio would no longer match what is configured.
    </p>
