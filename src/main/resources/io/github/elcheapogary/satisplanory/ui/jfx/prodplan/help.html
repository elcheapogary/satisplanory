        This screen is the production planner - a tool to calculate how many buildings configured with which recipes
        are required to produce a certain number of items per minute given the availability of certain input items.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are 4 sets of data that can be configured:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Recipes</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                These are the recipes the calculator will consider when generating a production plan.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can select any or all of the default or alternate recipes. You can search for recipes by name, or by the
                item they produce.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you select no recipes, or a production plan is not possible with the recipes you have selected, the
                calculator will attempt to find the best recipes to use and will suggest them to you.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Input Items</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                These are the items the calculator will attempt to use as input for the production lines. You can add all raw
                resources on the map by using the "Add All Raw Resources" button.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you add no input items, or if a production plan is not possible with the input items you have selected, then
                the calculator will attempt to find the input items required to create a production plan and suggest them to
                you.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Output Requirements</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                These are the items you would like the production lines to produce.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each item can have a minimum amount per minute and a maximization weight. The calculator will attempt to create
                a production plan that produces at least the configured minimum items per minute, and as much as possible of the
                items with a weight value greater than zero.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Note!</b> If you configure a minimum of zero for a particular item, then the calculator may create a
                production plan that produces none of that item!
            </p>

            <p>
                You must add at least one output item that has either a minimum number of items per minute greater than zero or
                a weight greater than zero.
            </p>

            <p>
                The calculator will attempt to balance the output items according to their weight. eg. If you configure Iron
                Rods with a weight of 2 and Iron Plates with a weight of 3, then the calculator will attempt to create a
                production plan which produces 3 Iron Plates for every 2 Iron Rods. This, however, is not strictly enforced.
                If, for some reason, fewer Iron Plates are producible then the calculator will still attempt to maximize Iron
                Rods, even if output ratio would no longer match what is configured.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Settings</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Here you can configure options for the calculator.
            </p>

    <p><b>Maximizing Output vs Recipe Selection</b></p>

    <p>
        When maximizing output items, there is usually only a single combination of recipes that produces the most
        output items. If you select the <i>Maximize Output Items</i> optimization target, this is the combination of
        recipes that will be selected.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to maximize output <i>and</i> use one of the optimization targets to select recipes according to
        those rules (like <i>Minimize Power Consumption</i>), then do the following:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>First set a minimum amount for each output item.</li>
        <li>Then, run the calculator using the desired optimization target.</li>
        <li>
            This will create a plan that is not necessarily optimized for maximum output, but it allows you so see
            the input items and recipes used when using the desired optimization target. Change your input items to
            the input items used by the plan, and change the amounts to the amounts of these input items you have
            available in the area.
        </li>
        <li>Run the calculator again, this time with the <i>Maximize Output Items</i> optimization target.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This will result in a production plan that maximizes output items based on the other optimization target rules.
    </p>
