        This screen is the production planner - a tool to calculate how many buildings configured with which recipes
        are required to produce a certain number of items per minute given the availability of certain input items.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are 4 sets of data that can be configured:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Recipes</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                These are the recipes the calculator will consider when generating a production plan.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can select any or all of the default or alternate recipes. You can search for recipes by name, or by the
                item they produce.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you select no recipes, or a production plan is not possible with the recipes you have selected, the
                calculator will attempt to find the best recipes to use and will suggest them to you.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Input Items</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                These are the items the calculator will attempt to use as input for the production lines. You can add all raw
                resources on the map by using the "Add All Raw Resources" button.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you add no input items, or if a production plan is not possible with the input items you have selected, then
                the calculator will attempt to find the input items required to create a production plan and suggest them to
                you.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Output Items</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                These are the items you would like the production lines to produce.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each item can have a minimum amount per minute and a maximization weight. The calculator will attempt to create
                a production plan that produces at least the configured minimum items per minute, and as much as possible of the
                items with a weight value greater than zero.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Note!</b> If you configure a minimum of zero for a particular item, then the calculator may create a
                production plan that produces none of that item!
            </p>

            <p>
                You must add at least one output item that has either a minimum number of items per minute greater than zero or
                a weight greater than zero.
            </p>

            <p>
                The calculator will attempt to balance the output items according to their weight. eg. If you configure Iron
                Rods with a weight of 2 and Iron Plates with a weight of 3, then the calculator will attempt to create a
                production plan which produces 3 Iron Plates for every 2 Iron Rods. This, however, is not strictly enforced.
                If, for some reason, fewer Iron Plates are producible then the calculator will still attempt to maximize Iron
                Rods, even if output ratio would no longer match what is configured.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Optimization Targets</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Here you can configure what the calculator should optimize for - what it is trying to achieve. There are various
                different targets which you can enable or disable and arrange in order of importance to you.

    <p><b>Maximizing Output Items vs other optimization targets</b></p>

    <p>
        Maximizing output items is when one or more of your output items has a weight greater than zero, and the
        <i>Maximize Output Items</i> optimization target is enabled (and near the top). This means the calculator
        should create a plan that produces as much of the output items with a weight greater than zero as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        When maximizing output items, there is usually only a single combination of recipes that produces the most
        output items. If you select the <i>Maximize Output Items</i> optimization target, this is the combination of
        recipes that will be selected.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are trying to use another optimization target, like <i>Minimize Power Consumption</i>, and also want to
        create as many of an output item as possible it can get tricky, as <i>Maximize Output Items</i> and
        <i>Minimize Power Consumption</i> are usually contradictory. If you make <i>Maximize Output Items</i> more
        important, then the calculator will select the plan that produces the most output items without considering
        power (unless multiple recipe combinations result in the same maximum output items). If you make
        <i>Minimize Power Consumption</i> more important, then the calculator will generate a minimal plan that uses as
        little power as possible and not create as many of the output item as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is a strategy for maximizing output items subject to another optimization target:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Set <i>Input Items</i> to what you have available, or add all raw resources to see what you may need.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                First set a minimum amount for each output item. This should be less than the total you expect to be
                produced. Even a minimum output of 1 should work.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Then, run the calculator with the desired optimization target, eg. <i>Minimize Power Consumption</i>,
                enabled, and <i>Maximize Output Items</i> disabled.
            </p>
            <p>
                This will create a plan that is not necessarily optimized for maximum output, but it allows you so see
                the input items and recipes used when using the desired optimization target.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Select only the recipes used in the generated plan. There is a convenient <i>Current plan recipes only</i>
                button at the top of the <i>Recipes</i> section to do this.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Run the calculator again, this time with the <i>Maximize Output Items</i> optimization target enabled
                and prioritized. This will create as many of the output items as possible, but only using the recipes
                determined by the previous optimization target.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
