    <b>HOW THIS SOFTWARE READS AND STORES DATA</b>
</p>

<p>
    This software stores some data in a directory named
    <tt>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Satisplanory</tt> on Windows, and either <tt>$XDG_DATA_HOME/Satisplanory</tt> or
    <tt>~/.local/share/Satisplanory</tt> on Linux or other Unix-like operating systems.
</p>

<p>
    This software also reads data from your installation of Satisfactory. This software reads the item, building and
    recipe data that is packaged with the game.
</p>

<p>
    Satisplanory will attempt to figure out where Satisfactory is installed by checking Steam and Epic. If Satisplanory
    cannot find the Satisfactory installation, you will be prompted to select the installation path of Satisfactory.
    Thereafter, the software automatically reads the data from the Satisfactory installation each time it starts.
</p>

<p>
    This software does not modify or write to your Satisfactory installation in any way.
</p>

<p>
    This software only connects to the Internet when you export production plans to links, import from links, or to
    check for availability of new versions.
