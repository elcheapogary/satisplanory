# Satisplanory

A desktop application with a production calculator for Satisfactory.

## Download

You can get the latest version here: https://github.com/elcheapogary/satisplanory/releases/latest

## Installation

1. Download the zip file
2. Extract the zip file (to anywhere, it doesn't matter)
3. Run `satisplanory.exe` in the extracted zip folder

Satisplanory uses recipe and item information from your Satisfactory installation. Don't worry, we make
no changes to the Satisfactory installation, we just read some data to use in calculations. The first time
you run Satisplanory, it will try and figure out where you have Satisfactory installed. If it cannot find
Satisfactory, you will be prompted to select your Satisfactory installation directory. Just browse to where
ever your Satisfactory installation is and select it. On Steam the folder should be called `Satisfactory`,
on Epic, it should be `SatisfactoryEarlyAccess` or `SatisfactoryExperimental`.
