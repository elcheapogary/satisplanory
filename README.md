A desktop application with a production calculator for Satisfactory.

## Download

You can get the latest version here: https://github.com/elcheapogary/satisplanory/releases/latest

## Installation

1. Download the zip file
2. Extract the zip file (to anywhere, it doesn't matter)
3. Run `satisplanory.exe` in the extracted zip folder

The first time you run it, you will be prompted to select your Satisfactory installation directory.
